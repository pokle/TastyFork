TastyFork
====

Allow multiple people to edit the same document.

TastyFork gives you a Key-Value store that can be sync'd with remote TastyFork stores.

Lets use the terminology of the ubiquitous TODO app. A document is a list of todo items. TastyFork gives you a Key-Value store on the web browser that will synchronise live with a TastyFork Key-Value store on your web server. If conflicts are detected, TastyFork will create duplicate items - allowing your users to merge them as required.
